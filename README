DESCRIPTION

This package contains a class to geocode locations using
http://geocoder.us/.

This is ALPHA CODE. Among other things, this means that there are NO
functional tests whatever, and the public interface is NOT stable.

INSTALLATION

This package is installable by either of the two usual incantations:

    tar -xzf Geo-Coder-Geocoder-US-9.999.tar
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

or

    tar -xzf Geo-Coder-Geocoder-US-9.999.tar
    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    sudo ./Build install

You should substitute the appropriate program name for 'make', eg nmake
(typically) under MSWin32, or mms or mmk under VMS. See
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe for a copy of
nmake for MSWin32 if you need it.

Of course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and drop
the .pm files into the Astro/Coord/ECI directory (creating it if
necessary) in the appropriate place in your @INC directories.
